## How your code editor helps you

Hover your cursor (sorry mobile users!) over the word `data` in the editor below.

<Editor
  id="1"
  modelsInfo={[
    {
      filename: "exportedData.js",
      value:
        'const data = {\n  thing1: "a thing",\n  thing2: "another thing",\n  IMPORTANT_THING: "What you were looking for"\n}\n\nexport default data',
      language: "javascript",
    },
    {
      filename: "importData.js",
      value:
        'import data from "exportedData"\r\n\r\nconsole.log("You can run this file using the green play button")\r\nconsole.log("Or just press ctrl+enter")',
      language: "javascript",
    },
  ]}
/>

You should see this:

<img src="/dataJS.png" />

Knowing the properties of an object can help us write code that uses the object. Maybe I knew there was an **important**
property, but I forgot that it was called `IMPORTANT_THING`. IntelliSense in VS code increases development
speed because I don't have to open another file to find the object properties.

We also see that the imported code is unused. Your editor provides all sorts of information!

## TypeScript makes you do extra work (for your own good)

Changing a file from JavaScript to TypeScript often requires writing extra code.
In the JavaScript file below I make an `undefinedVar` by assigning it to a non-existent property of the imported data.

<Editor
  id="2"
  modelsInfo={[
    {
      filename: "exportedData.js",
      value:
        'const data = {\n  thing1: "a thing",\n  thing2: "another thing",\n  IMPORTANT_THING: "What you were looking for"\n}\n\nexport default data',
      language: "javascript",
    },
    {
      filename: "makeUndefined.js",
      value:
        'import data from "exportedData"\r\n\r\nlet undefinedVar = data.nonExistentProperty\r\nconsole.log(undefinedVar)',
      language: "javascript",
    },
  ]}
/>

When I try to run this in TypeScript:

> Property 'nonExistentProperty' does not exist on type '{ thing1: string; thing2: string; IMPORTANT_THING: string; }'.

<Editor
  id="3"
  modelsInfo={[
    {
      filename: "exportedData.ts",
      value:
        'const data = {\n  thing1: "a thing",\n  thing2: "another thing",\n  IMPORTANT_THING: "What you were looking for"\n}\n\nexport default data',
      language: "typescript",
    },
    {
      filename: "makeUndefined.ts",
      value:
        'import data from "exportedData"\r\n\r\nlet undefinedVar = data.nonExistentProperty\r\nconsole.log(undefinedVar)',
      language: "typescript",
    },
  ]}
/>

**To avoid the error I must define a type** that says 'nonExistentProperty might exist'. In the type definition `dataType`
we have a `nonExistentProperty?: string`, the question mark indicates that the property may or may not exist.

<Editor
  id="4"
  modelsInfo={[
    {
      filename: "exportedDataFixed.ts",
      value:
        'type dataType = {\n  thing1: string,\n  thing2: string,\n  IMPORTANT_THING: string,\n  nonExistentProperty?: string\n}\n\nconst data: dataType = {\n  thing1: "a thing",\n  thing2: "another thing",\n  IMPORTANT_THING: "What you were looking for"\n}\n\nexport default data\nexport {dataType}',
      language: "typescript",
    },
  ]}
/>

This is TypeScript enforcing a style of coding where developers have to perform some
minimal documentation on their code in the form of types. It will be useful for future
maintainers of your code (yourself included!) to know that the object property might
not exist.

<Editor
  id="5"
  modelsInfo={[
    {
      filename: "makeUndefinedFixed.ts",
      value:
        'import data from "exportedDataFixed"\r\n\r\nlet undefinedVar = data.nonExistentProperty\r\nconsole.log(undefinedVar)',
      language: "typescript",
    },
  ]}
/>

See how we can catch errors during when we write the code, not during runtime. This speeds up development.

<Editor
  id="200"
  modelsInfo={[
    {
      filename: "catchLengthError.ts",
      value:
        'import data from "exportedDataFixed"\r\n\r\nconsole.log(data.nonExistentProperty.length)',
      language: "typescript",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Passing Things to Functions

When you write a function JavaScript has no clue what the type of the function parameters are (think about why this is true).
Function parameters will not provide IntelliSense because we never specified the type of the object, and
the object type can't be inferred.

When we import `data` that the type is inferred and information is displayed on hover, but `myData` is of type `any`.
That means no autocompletions or hover information in the function body.

<Editor
  id="6"
  modelsInfo={[
    {
      filename: "importDataFunction.js",
      value:
        'import data from "exportedData"\r\nfunction log_IMPORTANT_THING(myData){\r\n  console.log(myData.IMPORTANT_THING)\r\n}\r\nlog_IMPORTANT_THING(data)',
      language: "javascript",
    },
  ]}
/>

In TypeScript we can import the type and use it to declare the function parameter type. Hover around to see IntelliSense in
the function body.

<Editor
  id="7"
  modelsInfo={[
    {
      filename: "importDataFunction.ts",
      value:
        'import data, {dataType} from "exportedDataFixed"\r\nfunction log_IMPORTANT_THING(myData: dataType){\r\n  console.log(myData.IMPORTANT_THING)\r\n}\r\nlog_IMPORTANT_THING(data)',
      language: "typescript",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Refactoring

When changing a piece of code in JS it can be difficult to figure out all of the dependent pieces of
code that also need to be changed. Suppose we want to remove the field `fullName` from the following code.
We have to delete the field from each element of `data`.

Then we have to look into `namePrinterJS` to see
that there is a reference to a deleted field. JavaScript has no clue the field has been deleted, and our code
will have a new bug.
In addition we didn't declare the variable fullNameList, which is a thing you can do in JavaScript and it will
overwrite global variables.

<Editor
  id="8"
  modelsInfo={[
    {
      value:
        'const data = [\r\n  {\r\n    firstName: "Eric",\r\n    lastName: "Cartman",\r\n    fullName: "Eric Cartman"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    firstName: "Kyle",\r\n    lastName: "Broflovski",\r\n    fullName: "Kyle Broflovski"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    firstName: "Stan",\r\n    lastName: "Marsh",\r\n    fullName: "Stan Marsh"\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n\r\nexport {data}',
      filename: "dataStoreJS.js",
      language: "javascript",
    },
    {
      value:
        'import {data} from "dataStoreJS"\r\n\r\nfunction printNames(allNames) {\r\n  fullNameList = allNames.map(name => name.fullName)\r\n  console.log(fullNameList.join(", "))\r\n}\r\nprintNames(data)',
      filename: "namePrinterJS.js",
      language: "javascript",
      notInitial: true,
    },
  ]}
/>

In TypeScript I can modify my type definition and all code that contradicts my new type definition will
give an error. Maybe for fun you can fix the code.

<EditorWrapper
  id="9"
  modelsInfo={[
    {
      value:
        'type nameType = {\r\n  firstName: string,\r\n  lastName: string,\r\n}\r\n//TODO: remove fullName field\r\nconst data: nameType[] = [\r\n  {\r\n    firstName: "Eric",\r\n    lastName: "Cartman",\r\n    fullName: "Eric Cartman"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    firstName: "Kyle",\r\n    lastName: "Broflovski",\r\n    fullName: "Kyle Broflovski"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    firstName: "Stan",\r\n    lastName: "Marsh",\r\n    fullName: "Stan Marsh"\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n\r\nexport {data, nameType}',
      filename: "dataStoreTS.ts",
      language: "typescript",
    },
    {
      value:
        'import {data, nameType} from "dataStoreTS"\r\n//TODO: Redo calculation using name.firstName and name.lastName.\r\n//TODO: Submit problem using button below\r\nfunction printNames(allNames: nameType[]) {\r\n  const fullNameList = allNames.map(name => name.fullName)\r\n  return fullNameList.join(", ")\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport {printNames}',
      filename: "namePrinterTS.ts",
      language: "typescript",
    },
    {
      value:
        'import {printNames} from "namePrinterTS"\r\nimport {data} from "dataStoreTS"\r\n\r\nif(printNames(data) !== "Eric Cartman, Kyle Broflovski, Stan Marsh"){\r\n  throw {returned: printNames(data), expected: "Eric Cartman, Kyle Broflovski, Stan Marsh"}\r\n}\r\nconsole.log("Problem solved")',
      filename: "tests.ts",
      language: "typescript",
      notInitial: true,
      tested: true,
    },
  ]}
/>

## Summary

This is not an exhaustive list of everything TypeScript can help with. Just a few things I observed. You can contribute to the examples on
[GitHub](https://github.com/Open-EdTech). It is easy to modify the code samples. The green `<>` in the editor copies the modelsInfo prop
of the editor component to your clipboard, and the text is all markdown.

A lot of JS not TS users have workflows that they are perfectly happy with. I really enjoy the TypeScript workflow because everything
works the way I want out of the box.

We are working on releasing the embeddable code editor from this article to npm, it isn't perfect but we think
it is a useful tool for educational purposes.
