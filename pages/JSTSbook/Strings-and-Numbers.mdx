# Strings and Numbers

## Declaring Variables

Variables let you store a `value` and reuse it in different parts of your code. A `value` is just some piece of information stored in your 
computer. There are different types of values (like numbers), but we will focus on letters inside quotation marks for now. 
The two good ways to **declare** a variable are using the words `let` and `const`, we will talk about the bad ways later.

<Editor
  id="4"
  modelsInfo={[{"filename":"makeVars.js","value":"let var1 = \"from let\"\r\nconst var2 = \"from const\"\r\n//variables are stored in the variable names\r\nconsole.log(var1)\r\nconsole.log(var2)","language":"javascript"}]}
/>

You cannot declare a variable twice, run the code to see <code style={{backgroundColor: "#290000", color: "#FF8080", borderTop: "1px solid #5B0000", borderBottom: "1px solid #5B0000"}}>
SyntaxError: Identifier 'var1' has already been declared</code>

<Editor
  id="-3"
  modelsInfo={[{"filename":"noDoubleDeclare.js","value":"let var1 = \"declare once\"\r\nlet var1 = \"declare twice\"","language":"javascript"}]}
/>

TypeScript will tell you that the code will not work **BEFORE** you run the code. Notice that the file is a TypeScript file,
pay attention to this when using this website! Hover your cursor over `var1` to see the error message.

<Editor
  id="-4"
  modelsInfo={[{"filename":"noDoubleDeclare.ts","value":"let var1 = \"declare once\"\r\nlet var1 = \"declare twice\"","language":"typescript"}]}
/>

You should have seen something like this: 

<img
style={{margin: "0 auto"}}
          className="self-center flex-1 mt-0 mb-0"
          src="/JSTSbook/VarsAndStrings/TS-redeclare-error.png"
          alt="ts error"
        />

## Assigning Variables

After you declare a variable using `let` you can **assign** the variable by setting it equal to another value WITHOUT saying **let** again.

<Editor
  id="-2"
  modelsInfo={[{"filename":"reassign.js","value":"let var1 = \"Use let to declare var1\"\r\nvar1 = \"no let the second time you use the variable!\"","language":"javascript"}]}
/>

### let vs. const

Sometimes things shouldn't change, you can enforce and communicate this by using `const`.

<Editor
  id="5"
  modelsInfo={[{"filename":"goodConst.js","value":"let age = \"10\" //age can change\r\nconst birthday = \"April 1\" //birthday can't change","language":"javascript"}]}
/>

The difference between `let` and `const` is that you can reassign `let` but not `const`. Run the code below to see <code style={{backgroundColor: "#290000", color: "#FF8080", borderTop: "1px solid #5B0000", borderBottom: "1px solid #5B0000"}}>
TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.</code> Notice that `fromLet` gets printed before the error because the error happens after the `console.log`.

<Editor
  id="6"
  modelsInfo={[{"filename":"cantReassignConst.js","value":"let fromLet = \"from let\"\r\nconst fromConst = \"from const\"\r\nfromLet = \"reassign let\"\r\nconsole.log(fromLet)\r\nfromConst = \"this will cause an error\"","language":"javascript"}]}
/>

TypeScript will show an error with red squiggly lines. Hover your cursor over the error for more information.
Run the code to see an error, but this time the `console.log` in line 4 doesn't run. This is because TypeScript checks for 
any red squiggly lines (syntax errors) before it runs your code.

<Editor
  id="7"
  modelsInfo={[{"filename":"cantReassignConst.ts","value":"let fromLet = \"from let\"\r\nconst fromConst = \"from const\"\r\nfromLet = \"reassign let\"\r\nconsole.log(fromLet)\r\nfromConst = \"this will cause an error\"","language":"typescript"}]}
/>

## TypeScript in this course

We want you to be comfortable in both JavaScript and TypeScript, so we 
include both languages in our examples and exercises. From your perspective TypeScript is a version of JavaScript that refuses to run your code 
unless you follow certain extra rules. 

TypeScript's extra rules cause some errors with our editor.
Often we multiple files, notice the tabs. TypeScript treats these separate files as if 
they were a single file when checking for errors, so we see <code style={{backgroundColor: "#290000", color: "#FF8080", borderTop: "1px solid #5B0000", borderBottom: "1px solid #5B0000"}}>
Cannot redeclare block-scoped variable 'error'.</code>

<Editor
  id="8"
  modelsInfo={[{"filename":"file1.ts","value":"let error = \"I'm in file 1\"","language":"typescript"},{"value":"let error = \"I'm in file 2\"","filename":"file2.ts","language":"typescript"}]}
/>

This is the same error we got in this file.

<Editor
  id="-4"
  modelsInfo={[{"filename":"noDoubleDeclare.ts","value":"let var1 = \"declare once\"\r\nlet var1 = \"declare twice\"","language":"typescript"}]}
/>

You can pretend that all declarations belong to the same file for purposes of understanding errors.
Unless that file is a module (see below).

## Modules

The [TypeScript handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/modules.html) states: 

> a file without any top-level import or export declarations is treated as a script whose contents are available in the global scope (and therefore to modules as well).

This explains our error, the variable is declared twice in the global scope. Files with 
import or export statements are called modules.

<Editor
  id="9"
  modelsInfo={[{"filename":"module.ts","value":"let noError = \"I'm in a module, look below\"\r\n\r\nexport {noError}","language":"typescript"}]}
/>

Variable declarations in a module are isolated to that module. The file below is not a module, it has no import or export statements. Duplicate declarations will cause errors,
`error` defined in the previous section in `file2.ts` which is also not a module. There is no error for `noError` from `module.ts`. It's declaration in that module is known only in the module.

<Editor
  id="10"
  modelsInfo={[{"filename":"file3.ts","value":"let error = \"still an error\"\r\nlet noError = \"I can't see the declaration in the module above, no error\"","language":"typescript"}]}
/>

If something is exported from a module we can `import` and use it in other files. This helps us organize our code.

<Editor
  id="11"
  modelsInfo={[{"filename":"import.ts","value":"import { noError } from \"module\" //Use the file name to import\r\n//We can use the value now\r\nconsole.log(noError)","language":"typescript"}]}
/>



<div style={{margin: 40}} />

## Viewing Data Types

Every *value* in the previous section was created with double quotes `""`, these are of type `string`. A value can also be a number. 
You can ask for the type of a value with `typeof`.

<Editor
  id="1"
  modelsInfo={[{"filename":"typeof.js","value":"console.log(typeof \"I'm a string\")\r\nconsole.log(typeof 2)","language":"javascript"}]}
/>

You can hover over a variable to see what type it is. This way you don't have to run the code and console log to find the type.

<Editor
  id="2"
  modelsInfo={[{"filename":"hoverType.js","value":"let hoverString = \"Hover the variable!\"\r\nlet hoverNumber = \"Me too! Me too!\"","language":"javascript"}]}
/>

You should see something like this:

<img
style={{margin: "0 auto"}}
          className="self-center flex-1 mt-0 mb-0"
          src="/JSTSbook/VarsAndStrings/hoverString.png"
          alt="ts error"
        />

The editor is smart and can tell what type things are. In TypeScript that information is used to enforce a consistent type for the variable. <code style={{backgroundColor: "#290000", color: "#FF8080", borderTop: "1px solid #5B0000", borderBottom: "1px solid #5B0000"}}>
Type '2' is not assignable to type 'string'.</code> More on this later.

<Editor
  id="3"
  modelsInfo={[{"filename":"curious.ts","value":"let hoverString = \"Hover the variable!\"\r\nlet hoverNumber = \"Me too! Me too!\"","language":"typescript"}]}
/>
