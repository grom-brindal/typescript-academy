## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a programming language that can run inside a web browser. 
Web browsers don't generally run Python or Java so it is necessary for web developers to know JavaScript. 
JavaScript also runs outside the web browser. JavaScript should cover your needs as a web developer. 

### ECMAScript?

JavaScript is a language that has changed over time. The organization responsible for making changes to JavaScript is 
Ecma International, formerly known as the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA). 
A new JavaScript specification has been coming out every year for the last few years. The specification 
is actually called the ECMAScript specification. Usually JavaScript and ECMAScript can be used interchangeably.

JavaScript is a general way of talking about the language, if you want to be specific about which specification
you are talking about say something like "ECMAScript 2020". The naming conventions are confusing. 
ES6, ES2015, and ECMAScript 2015 all refer to the 6th edition of the ECMAScript
specification, ECMAScript 2015.

### Differences in browsers

Because there are multiple versions of JavaScript, different web browsers run different versions. To be more precise, 
ECMAScript is a specification and the web browser is responsible for implementing its own JavaScript engine based on 
the specification.

All major browsers work with ECMAScript 2011 (ES5) but not all browsers work well with ECMAScript 2015 (ES6), most 
notably Internet Explorer. This website shouldn't work on Internet Explorer because I used an ES6 feature.

### Transpilation

There is a program called Babel that takes new JavaScript and turns it into old ES5 JavaScript, usually this is done 
to run your new code on old browsers.
The process of turning one programming language into a similar language is called *transpilation*.

## What is TypeScript?

Just like we can take new JavaScript and turn it into old JavaScript, we can take a programming language called 
TypeScript and transpile it to JavaScript. TypeScript doesn't run in web browsers, so this conversion is necessary.

<img
style={{margin: "0 auto"}}
          className="self-center flex-1 mt-0 mb-0"
          src="/JSTSbook/VarsAndStrings/ts to js.png"
          alt="ts error"
        />

In JavaScript errors happen while the program is executing, these are called runtime errors. 
In TypeScript errors can happen during the conversion from 
JavaScript to TypeScript, before any JavaScript has been executed. These are called *compile* time errors.

### Your first TypeScript Error

Here is valid JavaScript, don't worry about what it does. 
You can run it using the green play button in the top right. It should print "ello mate".

<Editor
  id="-100"
  modelsInfo={[{"value":"const hello = (greeting) => {console.log(greeting)}\r\nhello(\"ello mate\")","filename":"noError.js","language":"javascript"}]}
/>

When we try to run the code in TypeScript it says <code style={{backgroundColor: "#290000", color: "#FF8080", borderTop: "1px solid #5B0000", borderBottom: "1px solid #5B0000"}}>
Parameter 'greeting' implicitly has an 'any' type.</code>

<Editor
  id="-99"
  modelsInfo={[{"value":"const hello = (greeting) => {console.log(greeting)}\r\nhello(\"ello mate\")","filename":"yesError.ts","language":"typescript"}]}
/>

The error happened because TypeScript wanted us to give it more information. It wanted to know if our greeting was 
a word or if it was a number. Since we didn't specify this, TypeScript got upset with us.

### IntelliSense


You can hover over (put your cursor on top of) the red squiggly lines under 
`greeting` in line 1 to see a popup.

<Editor
  id="-98"
  modelsInfo={[{"value":"const hello = (greeting) => {console.log(greeting)}\r\nhello(\"ello mate\")","filename":"yesError.ts","language":"typescript"}]}
/>

It should look like this:

<img
style={{margin: "0 auto"}}
          className="self-center flex-1 mt-0 mb-0"
          src="/JSTSbook/VarsAndStrings/ts-implicit-any.png"
          alt="ts error"
        />

This is called **IntelliSense**. "IntelliSense" is the things your editor helps you with in 
Visual Studio Code. The main reason 
TypeScript asks for more information than JavaScript is to help the editor help you with improved IntelliSense. 
TypeScript forces you to help the editor help you.
More on this throughout the book.

### TypeScript in This Course

The authors of this book love TypeScript, so we teach it. We use both 
TypeScript and JavaScript files, you should be comfortable working in both languages. TypeScript and JavaScript are very similar.

## console.log

To do these tutorials you will need to run code and see the results. Run the code below by either pressing the green play button (on the far right of the light gray bar),
or press `ctrl` and `enter` at the same time after clicking into the text box.

<Editor
  id="1"
  modelsInfo={[{"filename":"helloWorld.ts","value":"console.log(\"hello world\")","language":"typescript"}]}
/>

`console.log("hello world")` prints hello world to the console below the editor. You can console log all sorts of words, play around!

<Editor
  id="2"
  modelsInfo={[{"filename":"allSorts.ts","value":"console.log(\"all❔ sorts😤🚠 of👥👳🏿🈲💪 words🕖⏪\")","language":"typescript"}]}
/>

## Comments

Sometimes we want to say something inside the code without it effecting how the code works. This is called a comment. 

<Editor
  id="3"
  modelsInfo={[{"filename":"comments.ts","value":"// Single line comment\r\nconsole.log(\"Code not impacted by comments\")\r\n/* Multiline comment\r\n         _          __________                              _,\r\n     _.-(_)._     .\"          \".      .--\"\"--.          _.-{__}-._\r\n   .'________'.   | .--------. |    .'        '.      .:-'`____`'-:.\r\n  [____________] /` |________| `\\  /   .'``'.   \\    /_.-\"`_  _`\"-._\\\r\n  /  / .\\/. \\  \\|  / / .\\/. \\ \\  ||  .'/.\\/.\\'.  |  /`   / .\\/. \\   `\\\r\n  |  \\__/\\__/  |\\_/  \\__/\\__/  \\_/|  : |_/\\_| ;  |  |    \\__/\\__/    |\r\n  \\            /  \\            /   \\ '.\\    /.' / .-\\                /-.\r\n  /'._  --  _.'\\  /'._  --  _.'\\   /'. `'--'` .'\\/   '._-.__--__.-_.'   \\\r\n /_   `\"\"\"\"`   _\\/_   `\"\"\"\"`   _\\ /_  `-./\\.-'  _\\'.    `\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"`    .'`\\\r\n(__/    '|    \\ _)_|           |_)_/            \\__)|        '       |   |\r\n   via https://textfancy.com/gallery/\r\n   */","language":"typescript"}]}
/>

It is true that if you take a JavaScript file and convert it to a \nTypeScript file there will be new compile-time errors, but I'm not sure I would call these bugs.

  <li>
    <p>
      Log "Problem solved" to the console. Pay attention to capitalization, "problem solved" will not work.
    </p>
    <EditorWrapper
      id="dskl"
      modelsInfo={[{"filename":"logProblemSolved.ts","value":"//This is a comment","language":"typescript","tested":true}]}
    />
    <p>
      Our editor detects that a problem has been solved when the message "Problem solved" is logged.
      You can cheat problems on this site by doing this, but why cheat yourself out of knowledge?
